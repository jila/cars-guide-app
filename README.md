## ToDo

- Unfinished, work in progress :(
- - The layout style needs to be improved
  - The TypeAhead components do not get updated when the form is submitted
  - The TypeAhead component for CarModel should get updated when CarMake is changed
  - The table needs to get updated when a new record is added
  - The table needs to have sort, filter, pagination
  - Edit a record needs to be implemented
  - Table only shows the results when the scroll moves!
